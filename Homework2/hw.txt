The first 12 coordinates popped are different in the queue and stack implementations 
because of the way stack and queue are implemented. Stack is a last-in-first-out data 
structure, so for mazes, it does a depth-first search. This means it explores one
path entirely before it moves on to the next path. This is because it pops first the last
thing it pushes, so it continues down the path completely until it cannot push any more 
of the path's cells (it is blocked). After popping all of one path's cells, it then pops
the next path's cells, since they were pushed second last.
On the other hand, queues are first-in-first-out data structures, so they do a 
breadth-first search. This means that if there are two open paths, it searches the first 
cell of the first path (since this is enqueued first then dequeued first), then the 
first cell of the second path (enqueued second then dequeued second), then the second
 cell of the first path (enqueued third then dequeued third) and so on.
